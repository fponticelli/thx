**This library is officially deprecated.**

*Use this library only if you need to support code written with Haxe v.2.x.*

The library has not been abandoned but it has been split in micro libraries covering specific aspects of software development.

The new libraries are documented on the (website thx-lib.org)[http://thx-lib.org/].
